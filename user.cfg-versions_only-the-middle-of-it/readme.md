try this:

FirstLetter of the Building (press several times for toggling)
 ==> build the Building

Ctrl+FirstLetter of the Building
 ==> selects Building or the Buildings

ALT+FirstLetter of the Creature
 ==> selects Creature or Creatures

### exceptionally other spellings:

### this selects all >D<angerous E. archer-,war-,hero-Elephant,... (not Support&Elephant):
hotkey.autociv.session.entity.by.class.select.(Elephant)&!Support = "Alt+D"

### this selects only Support&Elephant (not all Elephant):
hotkey.autociv.session.entity.by.class.select.(Support&Elephant) = "Alt+E"

# this selects only nowoundedonly using mouse (May think about oK. he is ok or so):
hotkey.autociv.selection.nowoundedonly = "K"

# this selects only woundedonly using mouse (think about: Lie down to bed better to geht healty again):
hotkey.selection.woundedonly = "L"
